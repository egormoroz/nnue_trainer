Huge thanks to the [wonderful stockfish document](https://github.com/official-stockfish/nnue-pytorch/blob/master/docs/nnue.md), describing how to build the whole NNUE thing-y from scratch.

Weights and selfplay data can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/hrtdind).


## TODO

- A proper trainer to replace the janky jupyter notebook
- Keep detailed training results
- Measure feature factorization impact, add more virtual features if needed
